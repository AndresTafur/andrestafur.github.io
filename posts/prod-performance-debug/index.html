<p>𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝘁𝗿𝘂𝘁𝗵 𝗮𝗯𝗼𝘂𝘁 𝘀𝗲𝗻𝗶𝗼𝗿 𝗳𝗿𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗻𝗱 𝗿𝗼𝗹𝗲𝘀:
50% of the job isn’t writing new features. It’s making the app fast, stable, and reliable for everyone.
→ Images that look fine locally but block the main thread in production.
→ Fonts that cause layout shifts on mid-tier browsers.
→ CSS that seems harmless but bloats the render tree.
→ Third-party scripts that quietly kill load performance.
→ Bundle sizes that balloon over time without anyone noticing.</p>
<p>Most developers only practice feature building. Very few practice 𝘀𝘆𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗺𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗰 𝗽𝗲𝗿𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲 𝗱𝗲𝗯𝘂𝗴𝗴𝗶𝗻𝗴 under real-world constraints.&rsquo;</p>
