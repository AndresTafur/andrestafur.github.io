<li>Node‚Äôs philosophy</li>
</ol>
<p>Node.js is built on libuv, which is an event-driven async I/O library. It‚Äôs designed around the idea: &ldquo;Never block an OS thread, everything is async.&rdquo;</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>How Node does it: Network I/O ‚Üí always async via epoll/kqueue/IOCP (same as Go). File I/O on Linux ‚Üí synchronous syscalls only üò¨.
libuv works around this by offloading file I/O to a thread pool. That thread pool does the blocking syscall, then pushes the result back into the event loop. So Node is ‚Äúasync everywhere‚Äù at the API level, but under the hood it sometimes uses blocking syscalls on a separate worker thread.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why Node chose async-only? Because of JavaScript:
JavaScript is single-threaded (per event loop). If any syscall blocked the thread, the entire runtime would freeze. To avoid that, Node had no choice: it had to make everything async. So in Node, async isn‚Äôt just a design choice, it‚Äôs a necessity because the language itself doesn‚Äôt support lightweight concurrency primitives like goroutines.</p>
